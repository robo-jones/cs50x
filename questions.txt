1.  stdint.h is the header file for a library that contains the various integer primitives that bmp.h uses (uint8_t, int32_t etc.)
2.  These types are essentially an abstraction for various fixed-width integer types that exist on different platforms, allowing programmers to write cross-platform code easier
3.  BYTE: 1, DWORD: 4, LONG: 4, WORD: 2
4.  A bitmap must start with the letters "BM" (6677 in decimal, 0x424d in hex)
5.  bfSize is the size of the entire bitmap file, biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER portion of the file.
6.  If biHeight is negative, it means that the pixels are stored top-to-bottom, left-to-right
7.  biBitCount specifies the color depth
8.  Either could return NULL if the user doesn't have the correct permissions to access the file/location. Line 24 could also return null if the provided filename doesn't exist.
9.  The third argument is always 1 because that argument specifies how many bytes to read at a time, and copy is designed to read the files one byte at a time in order to ensure that the BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER structs are populated correctly (the different fields contain different numbers of bytes).
10. padding will be 3
11. fseek moves the provided pointer (first argument) by <second argument> bytes, relative to <third argument>
12. SEEK_CUR means to use the current position that the provided pointer is at
